# The Changing Landscape of Tech Jobs and AI's Impact on New Graduates

## Interesting Article
I found this article from *The New York Times* incredibly insightful:

## About the Article
This article explores how recent **computer science graduates** are facing unprecedented challenges in securing tech jobs.  
Traditionally, tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta offered lucrative starting salaries and attractive perks to new hires. However, as companies embrace **AI-powered coding tools** and conduct mass layoffs, the job market for junior developers has become increasingly competitive.

Graduates are now finding themselves applying to hundreds — sometimes thousands — of positions with little to no response. Many described the process as *“bleak,”* *“disheartening,”* and even *“soul-crushing.”*

While the job market may be tough now, those who embrace new technologies and remain adaptable will be well-positioned to thrive in the evolving world of software development.

### Comment From Sunil Parab

One rather important takeaway I noticed in this article is the importance of having side projects. At the end of the article it says that the CS major they mentioned at the start of the article did end up finding a job, even if it wasn't the kind of job she was originially looking for. Thanks to her own side hustle she realized where her true passion was, and did actually find a tech related job. In a time where we're all worried about our potential job prospects it's important to remember that there are options other than just applying for a junior dev position at a random tech company, and that you don't even have to end up working in a heavily CS-related job (even if that does feel scary after all the time you've invested into CS).

### A Comment from [Kevin Yang]
Wow, this is a timely and slightly terrifying article choice. Thanks for sharing it! It really captures the anxiety a lot of us are feeling.

What stands out to me is the idea of adaptability. It’s easy to get discouraged by the headlines about AI replacing developers, but this article is a good reminder that we need to be continuous learners. It's not just about the CS fundamentals anymore, but also about embracing these new technologies.

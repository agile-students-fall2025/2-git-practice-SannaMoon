## About the Article
This article explores how recent **computer science graduates** are facing unprecedented challenges in securing tech jobs.  
Traditionally, tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta offered lucrative starting salaries and attractive perks to new hires. However, as companies embrace **AI-powered coding tools** and conduct mass layoffs, the job market for junior developers has become increasingly competitive.

Graduates are now finding themselves applying to hundreds — sometimes thousands — of positions with little to no response. Many described the process as *“bleak,”* *“disheartening,”* and even *“soul-crushing.”*

While the job market may be tough now, those who embrace new technologies and remain adaptable will be well-positioned to thrive in the evolving world of software development.
